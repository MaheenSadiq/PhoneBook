# 📞 Phonebook Management System 
 --using Data Structure and Algorithms

## 📌 Introduction

The **Phonebook Management System** is a console-based C++ application designed to efficiently store, organize, and manage large numbers of contact records using fundamental concepts of **Data Structures and Algorithms**. It demonstrates how to implement operations like inserting, updating, deleting, searching, and displaying contacts using a **linked list** and other data structures.

This project is built using **Visual Studio C++ (2022)** and serves as a practical application of C++ programming for managing personal or organizational contacts.

## 🧪 Sample Functional Flow

1. **Insert Contact**  
   → Enter Name, Phone, and Email  
   → Added to Linked List

2. **Search Contact**  
   → Choose criteria (name/phone/email)  
   → Match found → Show contact

3. **Delete Contact**  
   → Enter identifying info  
   → Contact removed from the list

4. **Sort / Remove Duplicates**  
   → Performed automatically after updates

5. **Display Contacts**  
   → Lists all current records
